# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2022 - day 4 ðŸŽ„

## Info

Task description: [link](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/4)

## Notes

- There seems to be no way around parsing a bunch of strings, splitting, converting to numbers with the input data.
- I started doing a lot of comparison operators, and things feel very verbose, which makes me itchy.
- Found a solution to part 1, but still wondering if I can refactor.
- Using a Set for part 2 feels more readable to me.
